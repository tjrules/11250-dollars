## Hello, Developer!

Today you have learned how to write an app with Node and Express from scratch, so let's apply this concept again by creating another API using Express.

A kid has come to you with an idea for an API to keep track of his candies. You love candies! So, you accept his proposal. You are given a resource Candy  (in the `/db/candies.js` directory) and use the kid's candy "data" to display it on the webpage.

Using `quotes` app as a guide, build your own application from scratch.

### Requirements

Your app should have the following routes:

- `/` - Root route, would welcome user and introduce the app
- `/candies` - all candies route would render a `json` containing information about ALL candies
- `/candies/:id` - would render a information about the candy with requested id.

Your candies routes should be in their own router file.

This will be very similar to the quotes route that we built in class but ðŸš¨ _don't_ copy and paste! ðŸš¨ Like we said earlier, the more you type something out, the better you know it.

#### Bonus!!!

Add a frontend and style it up! Practice those AJAX skills!
