# Full Stack Express - The Tutorial
A step-by-step guide to building a full stack ExpressJS app. In this tutorial, we will be building a movies app with user authentication via Passport. Our app will sit on top of a Postgresql database and utilize PG-Promise for db communication. We will us EJS as our view engine and templating language and deploy our app to Heroku.
