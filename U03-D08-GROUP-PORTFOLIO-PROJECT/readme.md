# Group Exercise: The Portfolio Project!!!

As a group you will recreate Jase's current portfolio into React.  The catch is that you will replace the actual projects with SWAPI characters so that we can make an API call.

#### First things first: Flow

* Git Tzar will create a `new` repository under their GitHub account and adds the team members as collaborators.
* As a team, agree upon the responsibilities of each member.
> Note: You have to sketch your app first, break it down into components and designate work to each member of the team.
* Create a separate branch for each member to work on 
> Note: make sure to give semantic names to your branches: Ex. "api-call-feature". 
> Do not name your branches this way: `kates-branch` (it's not explicit what work was done there)
* Each contributor should be creating Pull Requests that should be approved by ALL members of the team.
> REMINDER: make sure to write explicit meaningful commit messages. (Ex.: good message- `scaffold the app`, bad message - `update files`)


### A quick reminder of how your app should look:

#### Desktop and Mobile

It must render on both Desktop and Mobile.  You can make any necessary design decisions as to Mobile layout....in the end just make Jase happy.

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

Your app has multiple components and does the following things:

- Renders in both Desktop and Mobile
- Contains at a minimum the following components:  Header, Footer, Main (can contain as many more as you so desire)
- Renders just one character on the screen if clicked
- Fetches data using fetch or axios from the Swapi API
- Parses the information that comes back from the API call
- Renders the Sta
- Renders that information on the page

- **BONUS**: Upload your completed weather app to BitBalloon. (a little research is all it takes to get this done)

Things to think about:

- Should your app have state?
- How/when would you change state?
- What way will you make the API call?


## ðŸš€ Your solution submission should include:

- A pull request created on this repo. Make sure to include all members' names in the title. 
- A link to your **Single Separate standing** repository that ALL team members have at least contributed one commit.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## Take Aways

- What challenges did you encounter working as a group and what suggestions do you have to work through them during the Unit 3 Project?
- What strengths\weaknesses were discovered in this project and how can the group position itself to work to those strengths and help improve thoese weaknesses?
