# HOMEWORK: EXPRESS REPS!!!!

![meme](./assets/meme.jpg)

Tonight, you will be practicing your Express learning so far by _retyping_ the wonderful movies app we've been building together for the past few weeks!!!! YAY!!!

In this repo you will find two express apps:
- `narwhal-movies`: a full CRUD version of the movies app we've been building together for the past couple of weeks... with a twist. ðŸ¤”
- `my-narwhal-movies`: A file structure that looks a _lot like_ the movies app we've been building together... but it's **totally blank**!!!!!

Your task is to **retype** the entire `narwhal-movies` app into `my-narwhal-movies`. (You can copy and paste the style.css and reset.css. And you don't need to include the migrations and seeds.)

## ðŸš€ Completion looks like:

- Your `my-narwhal-movies` has a working express app in it.
- Your working express app has been **thoroughly commented**.
- **IMPORTANT**!!! You have committed after finishing _each file_.
- These photos were taken by another cohort. Obviously replace any mention of `delorean` with `narwhal`.

## ðŸš€ Your homework submission should include:

- A pull request created on _this repo_.
- Completion, comfort, wins, losses, questions... you know the drill.

## This homework is due ðŸš¨ 11PM ON THURSDAY NIGHT ðŸš¨
