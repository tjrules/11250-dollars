### Hello, Developer!

Today you have learned how to write an app with Node and Express from scratch, so let's apply this concept again by creating another API using Express.

You will have **30 min** to complete the task üëç

A kid has come to you with an idea for an API to keep track of his candies. You love candies! So, you accept his proposal. You are given a resource Candy  (in the `/db/candies.js` directory) and use the kid's candy "data" to display it on the webpage.

Using your `express-quotes` app as a guide, build your own application from scratch.

Your app should have the following routes:

* `/` - Root route, would welcome user and introduce the app
* `/candies` - all candies route would render a `json` containing information about ALL candies
* `/candies/:id` - would render a information about the candy with requested id.

Bonus:
* add some pictures of candies and display it on the page when a certain endpoint is hit.

### Please submit a pull request after completing.
