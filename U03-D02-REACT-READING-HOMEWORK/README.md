# Congrats on Project 2!

Nice work on the projects! You guys deserve a BREAK. But just a teenie one because tomorrow starts **unit 3** 

### Unit 3
In Unit 3 we will be covering more advanced topics related to everything we've learned so far, but the big Kahuna is going to be React.js. 

*Heads up*
React is hard (at first). The React approach React is quite different than jQuery, but is generally considered a step forward for organizing complicated UI's. React is simple and powerful once you understand the basic concepts. 

Becuase of this, we want to put your best foot forward... backwards... whatever, we're doing javascript again, and we want you to be best prepared. So here are a couple of videos to watch before tomorrow and a list of 10 thilling atricles regarding React and all its glory. 

### REQUIRD HOMEWORK:

#### Videos
[Introduction to Reactjs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxVg_s8xAms)  
Tom Occhino and Jordan Walke spoke about React.js at Facebook Seattle.  

[Separation of concerns RANT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZNIQOO2sfA)  
Separation of concerns is pretty misunderstood concept, in programming in general, no just JavaScript and web development. I talk about separation of concerns in the context of React and combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript in one place, but also in the more general programming sense in function extraction.
