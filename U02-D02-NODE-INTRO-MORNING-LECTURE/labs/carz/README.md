## Independent Practice (20 minutes)

Partner up with your neighbor - your task is to make a module together (`car.js`) that defines a car class â€“ with both properties and functions â€“ and export it as a module to a `main.js` file.


In the `car.js` file:
Write out a car class declaration.
Properties should include:
- make, year, color, convertible(boolean) - passed to constructor.
- speed (initially set to `0` for all cars).

Methods specs:
- include accelerate and decelerate
  - these should take one argument, the speed, and add or subtract it the from the current speed
  - return a string with the old speed and new speed
- one more method of your choosing ðŸ˜‰

In the `main.js` file, be sure to require the module.
Create a of couple instances of the car class and console log a message about your car. 
Call all the methods as well, with various arguments.
Console.log current speed of a car.
