# Classes & Objects & Methods

## Introduction

> This will be a pair programming exercise, which means you'll be paired up with the person sitting next to you, and only _one_ of you can have your computer open at a time.

> Whoever has the keyboard is driving and will type code, and whoever is not is the passenger, and will give guidance. You both will work together to creatively solve the problem, so you're equally able to come up with solutions – as long as you both communicate.

> To make it more challenging, every ten minutes, you'll have to switch drivers. We'll set a timer.

Your task for this module is to create five object classes from scratch, with methods & attributes to match. Keep in mind that methods can be both getters/setters, or actions that an instance of this object class should be able to do.

Methods can reference each other, and have the ability to change instance attributes. Try to really analyze how an object would look, feel, smell, sound, and act – and what someone might need to do with it in the context of an imaginary application you'd be building.

At the end, in the last 15 minutes, you'll switch computers with another team, and they'll look over your code to see if it's understandable, works, and has any errors.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

Your team will create 5 objects from scratch, with appropriate methods & attributes. You'll have ten minutes for each.

- Create an class that represents something in this room right now
- Create an class that one of your favorite existing web applications might have in _their_ codebase
- Create an class that represents a person who would use an application
- Create an class you could imagine being useful in application designed for students in this course
- Create an class that is a totally intangible, abstract idea

#### Deliverable

You should have 5 Ruby files, named appropriately for the object classes you're creating.
