Sweet libs is an opportunity to test your ability to pick up new technology without someone walking you through it. You will have a weekend to read the docs, practice writing code, and work to understand how and why someone would use a specific library/framework. Then you get to build something with it! Horray!

##### Quick note

sometimes docs can be difficult to read or are small.

You kind of just have to deal with it

### Timeline

You will have from right now until tomorrow morning to work with your partner. Presentations will start tomorrow morning. Each pair will have 10 minutes to present.

### Expectations

##### Quick start guide
Each pair needs to create a getting started tutorial on their topic. It should be:

  - Written in markdown and on a Github Repo
  - You should include screen shots, gifs, diagrams, or other tools that will help make the guide as useful as possible (but don't waste time on styling, this project is about content, not style).
  **But if you want to learn how to do cool markdown like me!!**  
  [markdown cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
  - You should look to the offical docs/start guides for inspiration, but make yours more approachable for WDI students. Think about what assumed knowledge is in the offical docs, and unassume it. Fill in the missing pieces.
  - Make sure to note dependencies, and similarities/differences to other types of tech we've studied.
  - Any code files that are needed should be included in this repo. This includes Gemfiles or package.json!

##### Presentation
Each group needs to prepare a presentation where they walk the rest of the class through the basics of the library/framework, demo the app they made, and talk about what use cases the tech has. The focus should be on the tech. Why would someone choose to use your group's tech? You should be prepared to answer questions from the class - and when you are in the audience, ask questions of the other groups. You should feel free to use whatever teaching techniques you'd like! Make to to make your presentations interesting and engaging, as everyone has to sit through them :).
