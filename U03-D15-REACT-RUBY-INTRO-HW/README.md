We've spent the majority of the course learning how to write JavaScript that performs logic in the **client**, as well as how to create our **server**. Next, we're going to begin learning **Ruby**.

## Unit 3 Project ToDo's 

Here are the last todo items for Unit 3 Project:

### Team Assessment Feedback

Please fill out the below assessment and provide feedback for each member of your team.  That means that you need to fill the form out 3 separate times, once for each team member.  Please keep it positive and provide feedback that will help the other person grow.

If you were going to learn a new programming language, what questions would you have? You've already learned one programming language, and you're about to learn another! Think about the things you now know how to do in JavaScript. With this knowledge, consider what you might want to know about Ruby. Take a few minutes to think about some questions that you have about this new language.

#### Examples:

- How do I define a variable in Ruby? 
- Is it different than in JavaScript?
- Where do I go for information about Ruby? 
- What kind of documentation exists for it?
- Does Ruby have functions?
